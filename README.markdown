tipCalculator - A simple ios app that works with input text fields
------------------------------------------------------------------

In this application, we will create a single view ios application. We will introduce
two input text fields for the Bill Amount and the Tip Percent desired. We will have a
button to Calculate the Tip Amount, which will be shown at the bottom of the screen.

The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with how the text fields are created in
ios, Xcode, and how the ViewController can be asked to be a delegate for the text fields.

We will also learn to read the values from the text fields and calculate the value.

To make the program more robust, we will disable the Calculate button, and it will only
be enabled when the values for both the Bill Amount and the Tip Amount are filled out properly.

Let's code!
